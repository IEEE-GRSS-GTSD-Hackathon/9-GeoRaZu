Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 6 - Clean water and sanitation – addressing issues related to water quality and integrated water management. The underlying fact of SDG 6 is goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources, which are critical to the survival of people and the planet. In situ data collection and mapping the water quality parameters is a laborious task and the degree of accuracy is low due the low sampling size. Satellite data is a boon in getting accurate parameters for wide range of time and area. Spatial-temporal analysis of surface water quality parameters using satellite imagery was conducted for Arkavathi river and its reservoir situated at Kanakpura. Sentinel MSI Level 2- A data was used from AWS open data Registry. The water quality parameters studied were Turbidity Index, Turbidity in NTU, Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI), Chlorophyll Index and pH. Thematic maps were generated for the parameter using Google Collab by Matplotlib. Time series plots were created for the duration from 01-03-2019 – 01-03-2023. The spatial temporal analysis gave a wider realm of understanding the dynamics of water quality parameters.

Material and Methodology
Data Used
In this study, we processed and analysed a Sentinel 2A (level 2) image was acquired for the duration 2019-03-01/2023-03-01. The data was taken from AWS open data Registry. QGIS was used for locating sampling points. Google Collab was used as platform for analysis of the data.

Study Area
Arkavathi Reserviour located in Kankapura taluk of Ramanagar District, Karnataka was choosen as region of interest. The Arkavathi river is major source of water for Kanakpura city, the following image gives the snaphot information of the region.

Conclusion
As is the case in the present with the Arkavathi River, which feeds into the Cauvery River, one of the main sources of drinking water for the area, surface water quality degradation in reservoirs and lakes is particularly important when they are used for crop irrigation and more-so for drinking purposes. Therefore, it is crucial to gather and analyse accurate data on spatiotemporal variations of surface water contaminants for a successful water management strategy. This data can then be used to pinpoint pollution sources and suggest corrective actions to enhance water quality.
